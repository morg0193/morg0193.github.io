For the creation of my portfolio site, I experimented with a number of different layout options. This definetly wasn't the most efficient method of creating the site,
but it allowed me to test my knowledge of almost all the techniques I learned this semester.

For starters, I utilized the Bootstrap framework for the navigation menu and a picture carousel. I also used both flexbox and grid for various layout components, which was
fairly straightforward, but still good practice.

One of the more challenging components of the development was my choice to work with absolute positioning for some of the picture elements. I wanted to try absolute
positioning because I felt it could be more effective than grid or flexbox for certain layout choices. Additionally, I hadn't really tried it before so I wanted to learn more
about positioning with css. This was probably the most challenging part of the development, figuring out the exact positioning of images and make sure any overflow was
properly hidden. Even though the implementation was likely more challenging than it needed to be, I feel much more comfortable using absolute positions and knowing where to
use them.

Another challenging element was the dynamic background image featured on the contact page. I hadn't done much work with background-image in CSS, so it took a while to
find the right combination of attributes for a scaling dynamic background image.

Additionally, the use of absolute positioning was required once again on the contact page to avoid applying the mix-blend-mode to the contact form. An easier implementation
would have been to add the purple blend mode to the background image in photoshop, but I wanted to challenge myself to think outside the box, even if it meant more work
in the long run.

Overall, I feel there are a number of elements that could be expanded upon in the future, given more time to prototype and develop. I decided to keep the portfolio sections fairly bareboned because it would have taken to long to develop things like case studies or extensive web-optimized photo libraries in the limited time during the semester. I do plan on implementing these features over the summer break.
